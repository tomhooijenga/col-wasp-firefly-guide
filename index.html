    <p>
      You'll need some basic items, as well as a Colonel Wasp Firefly kit.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Silicone grease</li>
      <li>Philips-head screwdriver</li>
      <li>Rubber mallet or hammer</li>
      <li>Sandpaper</li>
      <li>Utility knife</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first slide shows most of the parts and where they'll end up. The second slide shows us the various screws
      that we will use, and the plunger catch for scale. The black screws for the body (#3) are of poor quality and
      strip easily. It is recommended to use better quality screws instead.

    <p>Take the magazine tube and the central barrel holder. The tube needs sanding to properly fit.</p>
    <p>Insert it into the smooth hole of the barrel holder. It will be very tight, so I recommend to use some lube.
      If necessary, use a mallet to get the tube all the way in. Check that the tube connects to the barrel holder on
      the inside. If there is a gap, the ammo follower might jam when inserting shells.</p>

    <p>Take the barrel seal and the barrel. Put the seal on the barrel and insert into the central barrel holder.</p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">As easy as the barrel goes in, it comes out. Check periodically if the barrel is still in
    place or fix it permanently with some glue.</p>

    <p>Take both halves of the pump grip and screw them together with six of the long silver screws (#4). Flip it over
      and slide onto the ammo tube. It should be able to cover part of the central barrel unit, as shown.</p>

    <p>Next is the ammo follower. Insert the black piece into the orange piece.</p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
      It takes a lot of force to insert the black piece. However, the fins are easily crushed when the force is
      not completely in line with both pieces. If you do crush the fins, simply cut them off and glue both pieces
      together.

    <p>The final step of the barrel unit is to take the ammo follower and insert into the ammo barrel, black nose first.
      Then insert the ammo follower spring and close the barrel with the front barrel holder.</p>

      catcher, trigger and the barrel unit are still in place.</p>
    <p>The body can now be screwed shut with the black screws (#3). It is recommended to lube the thread of the screws
      so they swill go in easier and are less likely to strip.</p>
